### Where can I get a commercial license?

You can find out more information about getting a commercial license at https://getparthenon.com.

### How much does a commercial license cost?

### Do I get a perpetual commercial license for Parthenon?

When you get a license you perpetual license for the minor version of Parthenon that is currently released at the time of purchase as well as the right to updates for a year. If you subscribe to the year updates support you'll be able to always use the latest version. If you choose not to continue a updates subscription you'll be entitled to use the minor version of Parthenon that was available at the last yearly license update.

For example, if you buy a commercial license and the minor version is 2.0 and don't subscribe to a yearly subscription. You'll be able to use 2.0 and any minor version released throughout the year but once the update support has ended you'll be entitled to use 2.0 only.

Another example, if you buy a commercial license and the minor version is 2.0 and don't subscribe for 3-years and after the support license has ended you would be entitled to use the version minor that was available 12-months before. So if 2.4 was released at the start of the final year of update support and 2.5 was available at the end of it. You would be entitled to use version 2.4 after the the suport license is over.
